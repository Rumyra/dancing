Dancing
=======

Demos for my [24 ways article](http://24ways.org/).

[You can view them working here.](http://dancing.rumyra.com)

All code (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) is in relevant .erb files (e.g. Simple example code is in views/simple.erb) as this is for illustrative purposes.

You will need to use a modern browser for examples to work.

I would also like to thank [@otaiga](https://github.com/otaiga) for his help with the code and [@TreforJohn](https://github.com/TreforJohn?source=c) for his help understanding audio.

Disclaimer: The Web Audio API is still in [working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/), spec may change at any time :) I will try to keep this repo updated if it does.
